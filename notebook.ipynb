    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "# 1.1 Overview\n",
    "To expand its market footprint and diversify its investment portfolio, the company is preparing to enter the aviation sector. This initiative involves acquiring aircraft to operate within both commercial and private aviation markets. Given the significant risks associated with air travel—ranging from mechanical failure and environmental hazards to pilot error and maintenance practices—it is imperative that the company make data-informed decisions regarding aircraft selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "The organization currently lacks knowledge about the risk profiles of different aircraft models. Without a clear understanding of historical accident patterns, the company could unknowingly invest in aircraft with poor safety records, resulting in potential financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory complications. Therefore, leadership has tasked the data team with identifying the **lowest-risk aircraft models** to guide strategic procurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.3 Project Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze historical aviation accident data to evaluate and compare the safety performance of different aircraft models. The goal is to translate this analysis into **three clear business recommendations** that will inform the Aviation Division’s purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves:\n",
    "- Identifying aircraft models with consistently low accident frequencies or severities.\n",
    "- Understanding trends across aircraft manufacturers, types, and use cases (commercial vs. private).\n",
    "- Assessing the impact of contributing factors such as pilot error, equipment failure, weather conditions, or operational mismanagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.4 Business Goals\n",
    "- **Minimize Risk**: Recommend aircraft with the lowest historical accident rates to reduce the risk exposure for the business.\n",
    "- **Support Procurement**: Provide a ranked list or categorical insights on safe aircraft for commercial and private deployment.\n",
    "- **Enable Strategic Planning**: Use historical data trends to anticipate long-term implications of choosing particular aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
    "- Delivery of **three actionable and evidence-based business recommendations** supported by visual insights.\n",
    "- Development of an **interactive dashboard** that allows business stakeholders to explore aircraft risk profiles.\n",
    "- A **non-technical presentation** and a **well-documented Jupyter Notebook** that together communicate the methodology, findings, and value of the analysis."

    "## 2.3 Initial Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset spans **over six decades**, making time-based trend analysis highly feasible.\n",
    "- Certain fields, such as `Injury Severity` and `Aircraft Damage`, are categorical and may require normalization or encoding.\n",
    "- There are missing values across several columns, especially in fields such as `Weather Condition`, `Broad Phase of Flight`, and `Total Fatal Injuries`.\n",
    "- The column `Make` and `Model` are critical for our analysis since they relate directly to the business question on **aircraft risk assessment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Data Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: Several fields contain nulls or blank strings. These must be investigated for relevance and either imputed, ignored, or used as-is depending on the column.\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Labeling**: Categorical values such as `Aircraft Damage` or `Purpose of Flight` may be inconsistent (e.g., \"business\" vs \"Business\") and will require standardization.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Outliers may exist in fields like `Total Aboard` and `Total Fatal Injuries` and must be handled with care—especially in ratio-based analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.5 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
    "- Explore distributions of key fields (e.g., damage, injury, make/model frequency).\n",
    "- Create visual summaries to better understand relationships between aircraft types and safety metrics.\n",
    "- Begin framing metrics for risk analysis (e.g., accident rate per model, severity index).\n",
